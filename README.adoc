This guide walks you through the process of creating a Spring Hadoop YARN application.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple Hadoop YARN application with Spring Hadoop and Spring Boot.


== What you'll need

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor or IDE
 - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK {java_version}] or later
 - http://www.gradle.org/downloads[Gradle 1.8+]
 - Cluster or local single-node instance based on Hadoop 2.2.0 or later
 - You can also import the code from this guide as well as view the web page directly into link:/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)] and work your way through it from there.

== Hadoop YARN Intro

If you have been following the Hadoop community over the past year or two, you’ve probably seen a lot of discussions around YARN and the next version of Hadoop's MapReduce called MapReduce v2. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a component of the MapReduce project created to overcome some performance issues in Hadoop's original design. The fundamental idea of MapReduce v2 is to split the functionalities of the JobTracker, Resource Management and Job Scheduling/Monitoring, into separate daemons. The idea is to have a global Resource Manager (RM) and a per-application Application Master (AM). A generic diagram for YARN component dependencies can be found from YARN architecture.

MapReduce Version 2 is an application running on top of YARN. It is also possible to make similar custom YARN based application which have nothing to do with MapReduce, it is simply running YARN application. However, writing a custom YARN based application is difficult. The YARN APIs are low-level infrastructure APIs, not high-level developer APIs.

== Spring YARN Intro

Application lifecycle from a moment when a developer starts his or her work to a point when someone actually executes an application on a Hadoop cluster is a bit more complicated than just creating a few lines of code. Lets see what needs to be considered:

 - What is a project structure for an application code
 - How project is build and packaged
 - How packaged application is configured
 - How application is executed

We believe that Spring YARN and Spring Boot creates a very clear story how above topics can be handled. 

At a high level, Spring YARN provides three different components, {YarnClient}[`YarnClient`], {YarnAppmaster}[`YarnAppmaster`] and {YarnContainer}[`YarnContainer`] which together can be called a Spring YARN Application. We provide default implementations for all components while still giving the end user an option to customize as much as he or she wants.

In a Hadoop world it has always been a cumbersome process to get your own code packaged and executed on a Hadoop cluster. Should you just put your compiled package in Hadoop's classpath or let Hadoop's tools to copy your stuff into Hadoop during a job submission. What about if your own code depends on something which is not already present on Hadoop's default classpath libraries, even worse what about if dependencies in your code collides with libraries already in Hadoop's default classpath.

With Spring Boot you can work around all these issues. You either create an executable jar(sometimes called as uber or fat jar) which bundles all dependencies or a zip package which can be exploded before code is about to be executed. In a latter case it's possible to re-use entries already available in Hadoop's default classpath.

In this guide we are going to show how these 3 components, {YarnClient}[`YarnClient`], {YarnAppmaster}[`YarnAppmaster`] and {YarnContainer}[`YarnContainer`] are packaged into executable jars using Spring Boot. Internally Spring Boot rely heavy on application auto-configuration and Spring YARN adds its own auto-configuration magic. User can then concentrate on his or her own code and application configuration instead of spending a lot of time trying to understand how all the components should integrate with each others.

== Set up the project

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with http://gradle.org[Gradle] is included here. If you're not familiar with it, refer to link:/guides/gs/gradle[Building Java Projects with Gradle].

include::https://raw.github.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/create_directory_structure_yarn_hello.adoc[]

=== Create a Gradle build file
Below is the https://github.com/spring-guides/{project_id}/blob/master/initial/build.gradle[initial Gradle build file]. If you are using link:/guides/gs/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)], you can import the guide directly.

`build.gradle`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/build.gradle[]
----

In above gradle build file we simply create three different jars, each having classes for its specific role. These jars are then repackaged by Spring Boot's gradle plugin to create an executable jars.

[[initial]]
== Create a Yarn Container

Here you create `ContainerApplication` and `HelloPojo` classes.

`gs-yarn-basic-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-basic-container/src/main/java/hello/container/ContainerApplication.java[]
----

In above `ContainerApplication`, notice how we added {SpringConfigurationAnnotation}[`@Configuration`] in a class level itself and {SpringBeanAnnotation}[`@Bean`] for a `helloPojo()` method. We jumped a little ahead what you most likely expected us to do. We previously mentioned {YarnContainer}[`YarnContainer`] component which is an interface towards what you'd execute in your containers. You could define your custom {YarnContainer}[`YarnContainer`] to implement this interface and wrap all logic inside of that implementation.

However, Spring YARN defaults to a {DefaultYarnContainer}[`DefaultYarnContainer`] if none is defined and this default implementation expects to find a specific bean type from a `Spring Application Context` having the real user facing logic what container is supposed to do.

`gs-yarn-basic-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HelloPojo.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-basic-container/src/main/java/hello/container/HelloPojo.java[]
----

`HelloPojo` class is a simple `POJO` in a sense that it doesn't extend any Spring YARN base classes. What we did in this class:

 - We've added a class level {YarnContainerAnnotation}[`@YarnContainer`] annotation.
 - We've added a method level {OnYarnContainerStartAnnotation}[`@OnYarnContainerStart`] annotation
 - We've `@Autowired` a Hadoop's `Configuration` class

{YarnContainerAnnotation}[`@YarnContainer`] is a stereotype annotation itself having a Spring's {Component}[`@Component`] defined in it. This is automatically marking a class to be a candidate having a {YarnContainerAnnotation}[`@YarnContainer`] functionality.

Within this class we can use {OnYarnContainerStartAnnotation}[`@OnYarnContainerStart`] annotation to mark a public method having no return type or arguments act as something what needs to be executed on Hadoop.

To demonstrate that we actually have some real functionality in this class, we simply use Spring Hadoop's {FsShell}[`@FsShell`] to list entries from a root of a `HDFS` file system. We needed to have Hadoop's `Configuration` which is prepared for you so that you can just autowire it.

== Create a Yarn Appmaster

Here you create an `AppmasterApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-basic-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-basic-appmaster/src/main/java/hello/appmaster/AppmasterApplication.java[]
----

Application class for {YarnAppmaster}[`YarnAppmaster`] looks even simpler than what we just did for `ClientApplication`. Again the `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application.

One might argue that if you use this type of dummy class to basically fire up your application, could we just use a generic class for this? Well simple answer is yes, we even have a generic {SpringYarnBootApplication}[`SpringYarnBootApplication`] class just for this purpose. You'd define that to be your main class for an executable jar and you'd accomplish this during the gradle build.

In real life, however, you most likely need to start adding more custom functionality to your application component and you'd do that by start adding more beans. To do that you need to define a Spring {SpringConfigurationAnnotation}[`@Configuration`] or {SpringComponentScanAnnotation}[`@ComponentScan`]. `AppmasterApplication` would then act as your main starting point to define more custom functionality. Effectively this is exactly what we do with a {YarnContainer}[`YarnContainer`] in section below.

== Create a Yarn Client

Here you create a `ClientApplication` class.

`gs-yarn-basic-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-basic-client/src/main/java/hello/client/ClientApplication.java[]
----

 - {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath setting, other beans, and various property settings.
 - Specific auto-configuration for Spring YARN components takes place in a same way than from a core Spring Boot.

The `main()` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` method to launch an application. From there we simply request a bean of type {YarnClient}[`YarnClient`] and execute its `submitApplication()` method. What happens next depends on application configuration, which we go through later in this guide. Did you notice that there wasn't a single line of XML?

== Create an Application Configuration

Create a new yaml configuration file for all sub-projects.

`gs-yarn-basic-container/src/main/resources/application.yml`
`gs-yarn-basic-appmaster/src/main/resources/application.yml`
`gs-yarn-basic-client/src/main/resources/application.yml`
[source,yaml]
----
include::complete/gs-yarn-basic-client/src/main/resources/application.yml[]
----

NOTE: Pay attention to a `yaml` file format which expects correct indentation and no tab characters.

Final part for your application is its runtime configuration which glues all the components together which then can be called as a Spring YARN application. This configuration act as source for Spring Boot's {ConfigurationProperties}[`@ConfigurationProperties`] and contains relevant configuration properties which cannot be auto-discovered or otherwise needs to have an option to be overwritten by an end user.

You can then write your own defaults for your own environment. Because these {ConfigurationProperties}[`@ConfigurationProperties`] are resolved at runtime by Spring Boot, you even have an easy option to overwrite these properties either by using command-line options or provide additional configuration property files.

== Run the Application

Now that you've successfully compiled and packaged your application, it's time to do the fun part and execute it on a Hadoop YARN.

Below listing shows files after a succesfull gradle build.
